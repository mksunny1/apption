## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](./README.md) file. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git)

## Getting started

You can contribute to Apption in many ways. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:. These are just some of the ideas that scream to mind, in no particular order:

- Partake in project discussions. We want talk about this, both formally and casually, to increase awareness about all aspects of this project for all of us and to build community and support. You can start or join discussions [here](https://github.com/mksunny1/apption/discussions).

- Find or fix issues. When projects gain traction, many issues get discovered as it gets utilized in previously unforeseen scenarios. These will need to be considered and hopefully resolved to ensure the project continues to meet the needs of those that rely on it in their work. You will find many opportunities to contribute here simply by using ActionObject or visiting the [issues](https://github.com/mksunny1/apption/issues) page.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with apption, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/mksunny1/apption/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/mksunny1/apption/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)" for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
